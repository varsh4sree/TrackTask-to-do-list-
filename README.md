# TrackTask â€“ My To-Do List App

This is a basic to-do list web app I made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's called **TrackTask** because it helps you track your daily tasks in a simple way.

## What it Does

- Lets you add new tasks
- Lets you mark tasks as done with a checkbox
- You can edit tasks if you change your mind
- You can delete tasks one by one or clear all at once
- It remembers your tasks even after you refresh (using localStorage)

## How I Built It

- I used **HTML** to create the structure of the app  
- I used **CSS** to style it and make it look clean and nice  
- I used **JavaScript** to make everything work (adding, editing, saving tasks, etc.)  

Everything is written from scratch with no libraries or frameworks.

## How to Use It

1. Open `todo.html` in your browser
2. Type a task and click **Add**
3. Use the checkbox to mark it done
4. Click **Edit** or **Delete** as needed
5. Click **Clear All** if you want to remove everything

## Why I Made This

I built this for a front-end project to practice JavaScript and localStorage. I wanted to keep it beginner-level and easy to understand.
